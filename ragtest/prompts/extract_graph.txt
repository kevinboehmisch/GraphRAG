-Goal-
Given a text document and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among them.

-Steps-
1. Identify all entities. For each entity, extract:
- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized
- entity_type: One of the following types: [{entity_types}]
- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities
Format: ("entity", "entity_name", "entity_type", "entity_description")

2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all relationships. For each relationship, extract:
- source_entity: name of the source entity
- target_entity: name of the target entity
- relationship_description: explanation as to why they are related
- relationship_strength: a numeric score (1-10)
Format: ("relationship", "source_entity", "target_entity", "relationship_description", relationship_strength)

3. Output as a single list. NEVER add explanations. ONLY output the tuples.

-Examples-
Example 1:
Text:
Microsoft was founded by Bill Gates and Paul Allen. They launched Windows in 1985.
Output:
("entity", "Microsoft", "ORGANIZATION", "A technology company founded by Bill Gates and Paul Allen.")
("entity", "Bill Gates", "PERSON", "Co-founder of Microsoft.")
("entity", "Paul Allen", "PERSON", "Co-founder of Microsoft.")
("entity", "Windows", "PRODUCT", "Operating system launched by Microsoft in 1985.")
("relationship", "Bill Gates", "Microsoft", "Co-founder of the company.", 10)
("relationship", "Paul Allen", "Microsoft", "Co-founder of the company.", 10)
("relationship", "Microsoft", "Windows", "Launched the product.", 8)

-Real Data-
Entity_types: {entity_types}
Text: {input_text}
Output:
